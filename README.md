This repository contains the source code of Computerized Adaptive Testings (CAT) for assessing quality of life and of sleep among people with chronic pain.
CATs are innovative methodologies that allow for shorter questionnaire completion times, without compromising its evaluation capability.
They allow for an interactive selection of tailored items from a questionnaire according to the individual's previous response pattern and halts the assessment when a threshold is reached, indicating that enough information has been gathered to enable the evaluation.

These CATs were developed and validated by a resarch group at the University of Sao Paulo Clinics Hospital, in a cohort of individuals suffering from chronic pain of diverse causes, mostly of neuropathic nature.
The CAT for Quality of Life was developed based on items from the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment â€“ Brief, and the 5-dimensions 3-levels EuroQol questionnaires.
The CAT for Sleep Quality was developed based on items from the Pittsburgh sleep quality index and the insomnia severity index.

It should be highlighted that these CATs will only indicate the set of items from each of the included questionnaires that should be answered, as well as their respective order, during each assessment. 
However, due to copyright restrictions, it will not provide the content of each item. 
Access to this content, as well the original questionnaires themselves, should be made by the user, in accordance to the applicable legal and copyright regulations.
